# Marionette 5 migration log

## Target and baseline

- Target: `marionette@5.0.0-beta.2`; published source revision
  `13f4954c352e646c413091ffdd83f6da59404573`.
- Pre-install package inspection completed before target dependency installation.
- Baseline: `npm ci` passed; 49 component specs and 248 tests passed; 35 E2E
  specs passed unchanged. ESLint and Stylelint passed; the local editor-config
  check could not find its downloaded macOS ARM binary.

## Current state

- Migration base: `feature/marionette-v5` at
  `a8565bf814aaeefabb7b5275761772c78d307921`.
- Completed: PR #1771 replaced `backbone.eventrouter` with a local
  Backbone.Router adapter and was merged by a human.
- Completed: PR #1772 replaced Marionette 4's implicit Region child conversion
  with explicit View instances and was merged by a human.
- Completed: PR #1773 replaced the list-search Toolkit Component with a
  Marionette View that emits query changes directly and was merged by a human.
- Completed: PR #1774 replaced the shared patient-selection Toolkit Component
  with a direct Marionette View and was merged by a human.
- Completed: PR #1775 replaced the patient action dialer Toolkit Component with
  a direct Marionette View and was merged by a human.
- Completed: PR #1776 replaced the shared due-date Toolkit Component with a
  direct Marionette View and was merged by a human.
- Active step: remove both Toolkit `mixinState` integrations from clinician and
  patient modals in favor of modal-specific error updates and explicit renders.
- The final routing target was changed by human direction: retain Backbone.Router
  rather than migrate to the browser Navigation API.
- Intermediate PRs keep GitHub Cypress deferred; the unchanged Cypress contract
  runs locally before publication.
- Next after human merge: replace Toolkit Components with Marionette Views in
  bounded groups without adding a compatibility Component.

## Active-step validation

- Targeted ESLint passed for the four changed JavaScript files.
- The test-mode build passed.
- The unchanged clinician-modal and app-nav E2E specs passed: 2 specs and 21
  tests after review correction, including clinician and patient
  validation-error behavior.
- Full repository lint ran: ESLint and Stylelint passed, then the pre-existing
  editor-config check failed because `ec-darwin-arm64*` was not found.

## Friction and corrected failures

- Closed PR #1770 copied toolkit lifecycle behavior locally. That recreated
  Marionette 4 patterns and was abandoned before merge.
- A native Navigation API implementation was completed locally, then stashed as
  `native Navigation API routing experiment` when the routing target changed.
- The first local EventRouter constructor used object-method syntax. Backbone's
  `extend` adopts that value as the subclass constructor, but native object
  methods are not constructable. Changing it to a function-valued constructor
  restored the established Backbone extension contract.
- The first modal-state replacement rendered again for deeply equal repeated
  errors and moved focus back to the first input, unlike Backbone.Model state,
  which de-duplicated the same errors. Review caught this and both modals now
  preserve the equality guard.
